# My-Competitive-Programming-Journey
This repository contains solutions to various competitive programming problems I have solved as part of my CP journey. The problems are from platforms like Codeforces, AtCoder, and various online judges. The solutions are written in C++ and optimized for efficiency.

Each file contains my solution code and link of the problem from where it is taken.

So, I Started my CP prep from TLE Eliminators, They have 4 Level of courses.
My soln are of problem set given in
- TLE LEVEL 1.0
- TLE LEVEL 2.0
- TLE LEVEL 3.0
- TLE LEVEL 4.0

Each folder comprises of week containing daily problem 
- Day1 as d1, day 2 as d2,..
- Problem 1 as p1 and so on
- Bonus Problem 1 as b1 and so on

I generally participate contest on Codeforces, AtCoder and Codechef
- I have made separate folders for each of the online judges i use.
- Each will contain separate folders of problem I solved under a contest.

Example File:
 X.ONLINE_JUDGES.PROBLEM_NAME.cpp

X is no. of problem solved just keep order and check of questions.
